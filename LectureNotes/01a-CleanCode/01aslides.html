# What is Clean Code?

- .hi-crimson[Clean Code:] Code that is easy to understand, easy to modify, and hence easy to debug

- Clean code saves you and your collaborators time


---

# Why clean code matters: Scientific progress

- Good science is based on careful observations

- Science progresses through iteratively testing hypotheses and making predictions

- Scientific progress is impeded if 

    - mistaken previous results are erroneously given authority
    
    - previous hypothesis tests are not reproducible
    
    - previous methods and results are not transparent 

- Thus, for science that involves computer code, clean code is a must


---

# Why clean code matters: Personal and team sanity

- You will always make a mistake while coding

- What makes good programmers great is their ability to quickly identify and correct mistakes

- Developing a habit of clean coding from the outset of your career will help you more quickly identify and correct mistakes

- It will save you a lot of stress in the long-run

- It will make your collaborative relationships more pleasant


---

# Why clean code is under-produced

- If clean code is so beneficial and important, why isn't there more of it?

&lt;br&gt;

1. .hi-crimson[Competitive pressure] to produce research/products as quickly as possible
    
2. .hi-crimson[End user] (journal editor, reviewer, reader, dean) .hi-crimson[doesn't care what the code looks like], just that the product works
    
3. In the moment, clean code .hi-crimson[takes longer to produce] while seemingly conferring no benefit

# How does one produce clean code? Principles

- Automation

- Version control

- Organization of data and software files

- Abstraction

- Documentation

- Time / task management

- Test-driven development (unit testing, profiling, refactoring)

- Pair programming

---

# Automation

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro's two rules for automation:

1. Automate everything that can be automated

2. Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end

- There are two reasons automation is so important

    - Reproducibility (helps with debugging and revisions)
    
    - Efficiency (having a code base saves you time in the future)

- A single script that shows the sequence of steps taken is the equivalent to "showing your work"


---

# Version control

- We've discussed Git and GitHub in a previous slide deck

- Version control provides a principled way for you to easily undo changes, test out new specifications, and more

---

# File organization

1. Separate directories by function

2. Separate files into inputs and outputs

3. Make directories portable

- To see how professionals do this, check out the source code for R's [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) package

    - There are separate directories for source code (`/src`), documentation (`/man`), code tests (`/test`), data (`/data`), examples (`/vignettes`), and more
    
- When you use version control, it forces you to make directories portable (otherwise a collaborator will not be able to run your code)

    - use __relative__ file paths, not absolute file paths

---

# Data organization

- The key idea is to practice .hi-crimson[relational data base management]

- A relational database consists of many smaller data sets

- Each data set is tabular and has a unique, non-missing key

- Data sets "relate" to each other based on these keys

- You can implement these practices in any modern statistical analysis software (R, Stata, SAS, Python, Julia, SQL, ...)

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro recommend not merging data sets until as far into your code pipeline as possible

---

# Abstraction

- What is abstraction? It means "reducing the complexity of something by hiding unnecessary details from the user"

- e.g. A dishwasher. All I need to know is how to put dirty dishes into the machine, and which button to press. I don't need to understand how the electrical wiring or plumbing work.

- In programming, abstraction is usually handled with functions

- Abstraction is usually a good thing

- But it can be taken to a harmful extreme: overly abstract code can be "impenetrable" which makes it difficult to modify or debug

---

# Rules for Abstraction

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro give three rules for abstraction:

1. Abstract to eliminate redundancy

2. Abstract to improve clarity

3. Otherwise, don't abstract

---

# Abstract to eliminate redundancy

- Sometimes you might find yourself repeating lines of code with small modifications across the lines:

```julia
x1 = ones(15,6)
x2 = 2*ones(15,6)
x3 = 3*ones(15,6)
```

A better way to eliminate this redundancy is to write a function:

```julia
constructor(J,N,K) = J*ones(N,K)
x1 = constructor(1,15,6)
x2 = constructor(2,15,6)
x3 = constructor(3,15,6)
```

Now if I need to adjust the `constructor()` function, I only have to modify one line of code instead of three. This approach also minimizes typos in copy-pasting lines that are largely similar.

---

# Abstract to improve clarity

- Consider the example of obtaining OLS estimates from a vector `y` and covariate matrix `X` that already exist on our workspace

- We could code this in two ways:

```julia
βhat = (X'*X)\X'*y
```

or

```julia
estimate_ols(yvar,Xmat) = (Xmat'*Xmat)\Xmat'*yvar
βhat = estimate_ols(y,X)
```

The second approach is easier to read and understand what the code is doing

Note that I used `yvar` instead of `y` in the function definition because the variables inside of functions do not exist outside of them (see [Scope](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/))

---

# Otherwise, don't abstract

- One could argue that the examples on the previous two slides are overly abstract

- OLS is a simple operation that only takes one line of code

- If we're only doing it once in our script, then it may not make sense to use the function version

- Similarly, it may not make sense to use the `constructor()` function if I only need to use it for three lines of code

- This discussion points out that it can be difficult to know if one has reached the optimal level of abstraction

- As you're starting out programming, I would advise doing almost every inside of a function (i.e. err on the side of over-abstraction when starting out)

---

# Documentation

1. Don't write documentation you will not maintain

2. Code should be self-documenting

- Generally speaking, commented code is helpful

- However, sometimes it can be harmful if, e.g. code comments contain dynamic information

- It may not be helpful to have to rewrite comments every time you change the code

- Code can be "self-documenting" by leveraging abstraction: function arguments make it easier to understand what is a variable and what is a constant

---

# Documentation in Julia

- Julia has excellent built-in documentation called docstrings

- These make great documents above functions to increase readability

- It is also possible to use docstrings to automatically generate a code guide

---

# Docstrings in action

```julia
function estimate_ols(yvar,Xmat) 
    b = (Xmat'*Xmat)\Xmat'*yvar
    return b
end
```

vs.

```julia
"""
    estimate_ols(yvar,Xmat)

This function computes OLS estimates for dependent variable `yvar` and covariates `Xmat`

"""
function estimate_ols(yvar,Xmat) 
    b = (Xmat'*Xmat)\Xmat'*yvar
    return b
end
```

If you change the function `estimate_ols()`, e.g. to add a new argument, then you can easily make the same change to the docstring just above

---

# Time management

- Time management is key to writing clean code

- It is foolish to think that one can write clean code in a strained mental state

- Code written when you are groggy, overly anxious, or distracted will come back to bite you

- Schedule long blocks of time (1.5 hours - 3 hours) to work on coding where you eliminate distractions (email, social media, etc.)

- Stop coding when you feel that your focus or energy is dissipating

---

# Task management

- When collaborating on code, it is essential to not use email or Slack threads to discuss coding tasks

- Rather, use a task management system that has dedicated messages for a particular point of discussion (bug in the code, feature to develop, etc.)

- I use GitHub issues for all of my coding projects

- For my personal task management, I use Trello to take all tasks out of my email inbox and put them in Trello's task management system

- GitHub and Trello also have Kanban-style boards where you can easily visually track progress on tasks

---

# Test-driven development (unit testing, refactoring, profiling)

- The only way to know that your code works is to test it!

- Test-driven development (TDD) consists of a suite of tools for writing code that can be automatically tested

- .hi-crimson[unit testing] is nearly universally used in professional software development

- Unit testing is to software developers what washing hands is to surgeons

---

# Unit testing

- Unit tests are scripts that check that a piece of code does everything it is supposed to do

- When professionals write code, they also write unit tests for that code at the same time

- If code doesn't pass tests, then bugs are caught on the front end

- Test coverage determines how much of the code base is tested. High coverage rates are a must for unit testing to be useful.

- R's [dplyr package](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) shows that all unit tests are passing and that tests cover 88% of the code base

- [Here](https://julia.quantecon.org/software_engineering/testing.html) is a nice step-by-step guide for doing this in Julia, via QuantEcon

---

# Refactoring

- Refactoring refers to the action of restructuring code without changing its external behavior or functionality. Think of it as "reorganizing"

- Example:

```julia
estimate_ols(yvar,Xmat) = (Xmat'*Xmat)\Xmat'*yvar
```

after refactoring becomes

```julia
estimate_ols(yvar,Xmat) = Xmat\yvar
```

- Nothing changed in the code except the number of characters in the function

- The new version may run faster, but is more readable. The output is unchanged.

- Refactoring could also mean reducing the number of input arguments

---

# Profiling

- Profiling refers to checking the resource demands of your code

- How much processing time does your script take? How much memory?

- Clean code should be highly performant: it uses minimal computational resources

- Profiling and refactoring go hand in hand, along with unit testing, to ensure that code is maximally optimized

- [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benchmarking-in-julia/) is an intro guide to profiling in Julia using the `@time` macro

---

# Pair programming

- An essential part of clean code is reviewing code

- An excellent way to review code is to do so at the time of writing

- .hi-crimson[Pair programming] involves sitting two programmers at one computer

- One programmer does the writing while the other reviews

- This is a great way to spot silly typos and other issues that would extend development time

- It's also a great way to quickly refactor code at the start

- .hi-crimson[I strongly encourage you to do pair programming on problem sets in this course!]
